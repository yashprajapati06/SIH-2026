## Chatbot and Spatial Map integration

This fork's **main** branch includes the GSI historical map layer, source data, full-page landslide assistant and the integration for the separate floating chatbot. Start with the [integration guide for the website maintainer](docs/INTEGRATION_HANDOFF.md). The standalone chatbot is maintained at [yashprajapati06/sentinel-landslide-chatbot](https://github.com/yashprajapati06/sentinel-landslide-chatbot).

## The Problem

Landslide response is not only a prediction problem. Operational teams must bring together terrain, rainfall, historical events, roads, settlements, critical assets, satellite observations, field reports, and response actions—often across disconnected systems.

That creates a costly gap between **hazard intelligence** and **operational decisions**.

Sentinel NER is built to close that gap with a single operational workflow:

```text
Detect → Assess Risk → Understand Consequences → Decide → Act → Verify → Learn
```

The platform is focused on **Northeast India**, with an initial operational orientation toward high-risk corridors in **Mizoram, Assam, Sikkim, Meghalaya, and Arunachal Pradesh**.

## What Sentinel NER Does

| Capability | What it provides |
|---|---|
| **Operational Geospatial Map** | Interactive views of districts, slope units, roads, chainages, villages, assets, and recorded landslide events. |
| **Risk Intelligence** | Transparent, uncertainty-aware risk estimates designed to support human decision-makers rather than replace them. |
| **Consequence Intelligence** | Connects a hazard with potentially affected roads, assets, settlements, and operational dependencies. |
| **Early-Warning Workflow** | Structures warning information and operational follow-through instead of treating an alert as the end of the process. |
| **Action Center** | Brings incidents and response tasks into an operational decision queue. |
| **Community Intelligence** | Captures field/community observations so local evidence can complement institutional sources. |
| **Satellite / InSAR Intelligence** | Provides an architecture for earth-observation and ground-deformation signals to contribute to the operational picture. |
| **Auditability & Provenance** | Keeps evidence and operational decisions traceable with explicit source/provenance boundaries. |
| **Health & Readiness** | Exposes system health/readiness signals for operational reliability and backend dependency checks. |

> **Important:** Risk outputs are decision-support signals. The platform is intentionally designed with a human-in-the-loop boundary and does not treat model output as an automatic evacuation order, road closure, or public-warning authority.

---

## Product Experience

### 1. Situation Awareness

The command interface brings together operational metrics, external feeds, alerts, spatial information, and the current action queue so teams can understand the situation without jumping between unrelated tools.

### 2. Spatial Understanding

The map is not merely a visualization layer. It is the spatial interface for querying and understanding relationships between hazards and infrastructure.

Core spatial entities include:

- **Districts** — administrative operational boundaries
- **Slope Units** — terrain management units
- **Roads** — transportation corridors
- **Road Chainages** — discrete route reference points
- **Villages** — habitation locations
- **Assets** — critical infrastructure and emergency facilities
- **Landslide Events** — historical or observed events with provenance

### 3. Risk Interpretation

The risk engine is designed for explainability and controlled use. Inputs are captured as immutable feature snapshots, data-quality states are explicit, and insufficient evidence can trigger refusal rather than fabricated values.

### 4. Consequence Analysis

A hazard becomes operationally meaningful when teams can determine **what it threatens**. Sentinel NER therefore models relationships between hazards, roads, assets, settlements, and other spatial entities to support consequence-oriented decisions.

### 5. Action & Verification

The workflow extends beyond detection: actions can be represented, tracked, audited, and verified so the system supports operational accountability rather than one-way alert broadcasting.

## Geospatial Intelligence

Sentinel NER uses **GeoJSON** as the spatial interchange model and standardizes canonical coordinates around **EPSG:4326 / WGS84**.

The domain model is built to support spatial indexing and proximity/intersection workflows in MongoDB Atlas.

### Supported spatial queries

- **Viewport / overview queries** for bounded operational areas
- **Nearby searches** using a configurable radius
- **Point-in-geometry queries** to determine which spatial entities contain or intersect a selected location

The operational map is implemented as a client-side Leaflet experience and is intended to expose these spatial domain relationships through an interactive command interface.

---

## Transparent Risk Engine

Sentinel NER treats predictive risk as **decision support**, not autonomous authority.

### Feature layer

The defined feature schema covers:

- 24-hour accumulated rainfall
- 72-hour accumulated rainfall
- slope angle
- historical landslide count over five years
- road-cut height

### Data quality

Risk inputs can carry explicit quality states such as:

`VALID` · `PARTIAL` · `STALE` · `OUT_OF_RANGE` · `DATA_INSUFFICIENT`

When the evidence base is insufficient, the engine is designed to refuse a misleading output instead of inventing missing observations.

### Model lifecycle

The architecture uses a transparent logistic-regression approach with calibrated probability output and human-readable contribution logic.

Model artifacts are protected by checksum validation, and the lifecycle is explicit:

```text
DRAFT → VALIDATING → VALIDATED → APPROVED → ACTIVE → RETIRED
```

Temporal and spatial separation are also part of the validation design to reduce leakage between training and evaluation data.

---

## Consequence Intelligence

Sentinel NER is built around a simple operational principle:

> **A hazard matters because of what it can affect.**

Instead of stopping at a risk score, the platform can reason about the downstream operational footprint of an event:

```text
Hazard
  ├── Road corridor
  │     └── Chainage / segment
  ├── Critical asset
  │     └── Facility / infrastructure dependency
  └── Settlement
        └── Population / local impact context
```

This supports practical incident-management questions:

- Which road corridor is exposed?
- Which chainage or segment needs attention?
- Which critical assets could be affected?
- Which settlements are within the consequence footprint?
- What action should be considered, by whom, and with what evidence?

---

## Community Intelligence

Not every useful signal originates in a centralized sensor network.

The platform includes a community-oriented pathway for capturing field observations and local intelligence, allowing users to contribute information through a workflow such as:

**Photo / evidence → location → observation → warning context → operational review**

The intended role is complementary: community submissions enrich the evidence picture while maintaining provenance and review boundaries.

---

## Operational Safety Principles

**Human-in-the-loop**  
Risk intelligence informs responsible operators; it does not silently become an autonomous public-safety order.

**Provenance before confidence**  
The source and quality of evidence matter as much as the number displayed on screen.

**Refuse rather than fabricate**  
Insufficient data should be visible as insufficient data.

**Actionability over dashboards**  
The goal is not another information wall. The goal is to move teams toward a defensible next action.

**Auditability by design**  
Important operational decisions should be traceable to the underlying evidence and workflow state.

## Project Maturity Roadmap

Sentinel NER is intentionally being developed as a staged operational platform rather than a single monolithic feature drop.

```text
Foundation
   ↓
Security & RBAC
   ↓
Authoritative Domain + Geospatial Data
   ↓
Operational Map
   ↓
Risk Intelligence
   ↓
Consequence Intelligence
   ↓
Warnings / Actions / Verification
   ↓
Broader Data Integrations & Operational Validation
```

This staged approach helps separate **what the system knows**, **what it predicts**, and **what a human operator is authorized to do**.

---

## Current Scope & Validation Boundary

Sentinel NER should be evaluated as an **operational decision-support platform under development**.

Some integrations, predictive models, and environmental data pipelines may be in staging, standby, or fixture-backed validation depending on deployment configuration. A model existing in code does not by itself constitute operational validation in a live regional monitoring program.

That distinction is deliberate: the platform aims to make uncertainty visible rather than hide it behind polished UI.

---

## Why This Project Matters

A useful disaster platform should do more than draw a hazard map.

It should answer, in sequence:

```text
What is happening?
        ↓
Where is it happening?
        ↓
How credible is the evidence?
        ↓
What could be affected?
        ↓
What should operators consider doing?
        ↓
Was the action completed?
        ↓
What did we learn?
```

That is the product philosophy behind Sentinel NER.

---

## Contributing

Contributions should preserve the platform's operational boundaries, especially around data provenance, validation, security, and human decision authority.

Before opening a pull request:

1. Keep changes scoped and documented.
2. Add or update tests for behavioral changes.
3. Avoid committing secrets, tokens, or production credentials.
4. Make uncertainty and validation status explicit where relevant.
